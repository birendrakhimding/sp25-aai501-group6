# Group 6 final project for AAI-501

This project is a part of the AAI-501 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD).

-- Project Status: [Planned, **Active**, On-hold, Completed]

You should add an instruction how this project is to be used, installed, run, edited in othersâ€™ machine.
 
#### Project Intro/Objective

The main purpose of this project is to learn and apply convolutional neural networks.  Our team will be taking two different approaches.  We will hand-code a CNN and we will build out a CNN using the popular machine learning library: TensorFlow.  Each model will trained on the FER2013 dataset and will attempt to recognize the appropriate emotion given a picture of a given facial expression.
